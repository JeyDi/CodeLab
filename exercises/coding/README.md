# Coding

In this section you will find some coding exercise with different solutions in different languages.

I use this repository to learn leetcode and coding exercises to prepare myself for challenges, interviews and so on..

First important thing is how you launch and create different solutions in different languages.

## Requirements

I really suggest you to install `asdf` on your pc to manage different versions of programming language.

Note: `asdf` it's available only on Linux and Mac, if you want to use it on Windows you have to use `WSL2`.

Remember to restart the terminal after you installed `asdf`.

## Python

## Rust

1. Install Rust with `asdf`
2. Create a rust file
3. In the file put a main function
4. Launch the file in your terminal

## Javascript

## C++
